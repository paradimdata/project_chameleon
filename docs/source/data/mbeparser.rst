Molecular Beam Epitaxy
=======================

This module contains the functions for Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) data. Of these functions, ``mbeparser`` is the main functions, and the others are econdary helper functions. The main function, ``mbeparser``, was designed to sort MBE data, as well as allow users to plot data. These functions were designed based on the specific file structure from the MBE system for which this module was designed. The file structure that holds the data consists of only text files, so these functions may not work for data different file types or structures. 

MBE Parser 
----------
``mbeparser`` takesa a folder containing .txt files from an MBE run, sorts the file into useful files containing data and useless files containing no data, and then allows the user to either plot a file, plot and save a file, or check a parameter value. Here is an example of how the function can be used:

.. code-block:: python

   from project_chameleon.mbeparser import mbeparser
   mbeparser('mbe_run_folder')

In this example, the folder 'mbe_run_folder' holds all files from a given MBE run. These should be primarily or entirely .txt files. Three different folders will be created in the given folder: Useful, Useless, and Output folder. Folders that are likely to contain data are moved to the Useful folder. Files likely to contain no data are moved to the Useless folder. Plots generated by the user will be saved to the Output folder. If the user decides to plot a file, the plot will be a plot of the value from the file vs time, and the plot will be color coded to show which shutters were open at what times. If the users decides to check a setpoint, they must choose a file with setpoint data, and the set point within that file will be displayed. No file is generated for that action. When the user is done with the function, they must choose the exit option.

Below is more information on the main function, as well as some of the helper functions.
