Molecular Beam Epitaxy
=======================

This module contains functions for Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) data. Of these functions, ``mbeparser`` is the main function, and the others are secondary helper functions. The main function, ``mbeparser``, is designed to sort MBE data and provide options for data visualization. These functions were developed based on the specific file structure used in the MBE system for which this module was designed. This file structure consists solely of text files, so the functions may not work correctly with different file types or structures.

MBE Parser 
----------
The ``mbeparser`` function takes a folder containing `.txt` files from an MBE run, sorts the files into useful and useless categories, and allows the user to either plot a file, plot and save a file, or check a parameter value. Here is an example of how the function can be used:

.. code-block:: python

   from project_chameleon.mbeparser import mbeparser
   mbeparser('mbe_run_folder')

In this example, the folder `'mbe_run_folder'` holds all the files from a given MBE run. These should primarily consist of `.txt` files. Three subfolders will be created inside the given folder: `Useful`, `Useless`, and `Output`.

- Files likely to contain relevant data are moved to the `Useful` folder.
- Files unlikely to contain useful data are moved to the `Useless` folder.
- Plots generated by the user are saved to the `Output` folder.

If the user chooses to plot a file, the function will generate a plot of the data values versus time. The plot will be color-coded to show which shutters were open at different times.

If the user chooses to check a setpoint, they must select a file containing setpoint data. The specific setpoint value will be displayed in the terminal. No file is generated for this action.

When finished, the user must select the exit option to terminate the function.
