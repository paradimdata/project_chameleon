Laue .hs2 X-Ray Diffraction
===========================

This module contains the function for Laue hs2 X-Ray Diffraction data. This function was designed to convert Laue .hs2 X-Ray Diffraction images to .png images. The Laue images are converted from 16bpp images to 8bpp images. 16bpp images are typically hard to open on typical systems, so this function allows the images to be more easily read and processed.
