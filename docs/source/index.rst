Welcome to Project Chameleon. Project Chameleon is a package for designed for data processing in material science research. The functions listed below were written to help in the reserach process by allowing for data from files to be extracted more quickly, allowing for the plotting of data, and the conversion of data from an original format to a new, more accessible format. These functions were design based on test data from specific brands of tools. Many of these brands give specific file and data formats. If you are working with data from different brands, the functions may not work correctly. Each function details what kind of file it expects, so it should be easy to tell if a function will work for your purposes.
