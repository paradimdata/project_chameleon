=======================
Molecular Beam Epitaxy
=======================

This module contains a function called ``mbeparser()``. This function was designed to parser through the .txt files in a large molecular beam epitaxy folder to extract the important files. Users can then graph any of the important files that they choose. This function also calls a secondary function, 'find_shutter_value'. This function is used to decipher which shutters are open during the MBE run that is being parsed.
