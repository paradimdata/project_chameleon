Installing Project Chameleon
=============================

Docker Image
------------
The quickest way to deploy OpenMSIStream programs is to use the public `Docker image <https://github.com/paradimdata/project_chameleon/blob/main/Dockerfile>`_. 

The image is built on the `python:3.12-slim` (Debian Linux) base image and contains a complete installation of Project Chameleon. Running the Docker image as-is will drop you into a bash terminal as the user (who has sudo privileges) in their home directory. 

If you prefer to install Project Chameleon directly on your system instead of using a Docker container, we recommend starting with a minimal installation of Conda, the open source package and environment management system. The instructions below begin with installing Conda and outline all necessary steps to run OpenMSIStream programs.

Quick Start with Miniconda3
---------------------------
We recommend using Miniconda3 for the simplest installation. Miniconda3 installers can be downloaded from `the Miniconda website <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_, and installation instructions are available `here <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`_.

Installation and Requirements
-----------------------------

1. **Poetry**

   This package is managed using `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_, which should be installed globally on your system. Once Poetry is installed, you can install this package and its dependencies in any environment of your choice.

   **Install Poetry with pipx**

   The easiest way to install Poetry is via pipx. If you do not already have pipx installed, follow the instructions `here <https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/>`_. After pipx is installed, restart your shell or terminal. Then install Poetry with:

   .. code-block:: bash

       pipx install poetry

   Ensure pipx is installed on your base system (not in a virtual environment). Deactivate any environments before running the command above.

2. **Download the GitHub Repository**

   Clone or download the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/paradimdata/project_chameleon>`_ somewhere accessible on your system.

3. **Create a New Virtual Environment**

   While any virtual environment manager should work, the example below uses Conda. The Python version must be 3.12.2 or newer:

   .. code-block:: bash

       conda create -n project_chameleon python=3.12.9 -y 
       conda activate project_chameleon

4. **Install Boost**

   Project Chameleon requires the latest version of Boost in the environment where it is installed. On macOS, you can install Boost using Homebrew:

   .. code-block:: bash

       brew install boost

5. **Install Project Chameleon**

   Navigate to the project directory and install the `project_chameleon` package and its dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd project_chameleon
       poetry lock
       poetry install
       pip install .

   After running these commands, Project Chameleon should be installed in your local environment.

   The easiest way to access the packageâ€™s functions is through Jupyter notebooks. See below for how to use the package in a notebook.

Running in Jupyter Notebooks
----------------------------
Jupyter notebooks are recommended for quick access to Project Chameleon functions.

To use:

1. Open a Jupyter notebook.
2. In a new cell, add:

   .. code-block:: python

       from project_chameleon.rheedconverter import rheedconverter
       rheedconverter('example.img', 'example.png')

This example uses the `rheedconverter` function, which takes two parameters: a `.img` file and a `.png` file. It is one of the simplest functions to test that the package is working.

A test file can be found in the `tests` folder of the repository. A full list of functions and usage examples is provided in the **Data Types** section.
