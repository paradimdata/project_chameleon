Introduction to Project Chameleon
==================================

Project Chameleon is a collection of Python programs and modules that facilitate the processing of data commonly found in the field of material science.

What Project Chameleon provides
-------------------------------
In the field of material science research, there are some materials and measurements that generate unothordox file types. Unorothodox file types that are unable to be opened or processed by means that are commonly accessible can slow down workflows that include these files, or obstruct them entirely. Project Chameleon simplifies the process of opening and processing these files by extracting the useful data or converting files to different types without altering the data contained in the file. Project Chameleon provides programs that convert difficult to access files to more easily digestable files. Other programs in Chameleon allow for specific data to be extract from data sources that give excessive amounts of data. All files output by Project Chameleon are accessible through software that is default on both Mac and Windows operating systems.

The main programs offered by Project Chameleon process files from:
* :doc:`Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy(ARPES) <../data/arpes>`
* :doc:`Bruker X-Ray Diffraction <../data/brukerrawconverter>`
* :doc:`Laue .hs2 X-Ray Diffraction <../data/hs2converter>`
* :doc:`JEOL Scanning Electron Microscopy <../data/jeolsem>`
* :doc:`Molecular Beam Epitaxy <../data/mbeparser>`
* :doc:`Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy <../data/non4dstem>`
* :doc:`Physical/Magnetic Property Management System <../data/ppmsmpms>`
* :doc:`Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction <../data/rheedconverter>`
